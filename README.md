scapy-survey
============

802.11 signal strength logger using Scapy. Can be used for manual surveying.
I didn't find any free software to log the signal strengths easily from several locations.
Not even Kismet was good enough for the job so I had to write my own script.
RadioTAP header data might be dependant on the 802.11 linux drivers used.
